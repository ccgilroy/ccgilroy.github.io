I'm a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle. I use digital and computational methods to study experiences of community, visibility, and belonging, with a substantive focus on queer communities and LGBTQ populations. I have interned as a data scientist and quantitative UX researcher, and also consulted on survey data analysis. 

My recent [research projects](/research/) examine expressions and experiences of community, the disclosure of sexual identities on social media, and demographic and economic changes in gay neighborhoods. In other work, I have modeled the impact of coming out on public opinion and used machine learning combined with human knowledge to attempt to predict life outcomes from survey data. I also strive to create open and accessible [teaching materials](/teaching/), especially for computational social science methods and tools.

I plan to graduate in 2023, and I'm interested in positions in data science and quantitative social science. To learn more about my work, you can view my [1-page resume](/gilroy_resume.pdf) or my [full CV](/gilroy_cv.pdf).

My name is pronounced [/ˈkɒnər ˈgɪlrɔɪ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English). I generally use [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) pronouns.

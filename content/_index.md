I'm a machine learning data scientist at [Blue Rose Research](https://blueroseresearch.org/about/), where I work on political forecasting. I have a PhD in sociology from the University of Washington, and I currently live in Seattle.

My [academic research](/research/) has used digital and computational methods to study community, identity, social change, with a substantive focus on queer communities and LGBTQ populations. I've examined the construction of meanings of "community" in digital spaces through word embeddings, trajectories of demographic and socioeconomic change in gayborhoods, and the disclosure of sexual identities on social media. I've striven to create open and accessible [teaching materials](/teaching/), especially for computational social science methods and tools.

Previously, I've interned as a data scientist and quantitative UX researcher at Meta, and consulted on survey data analysis for the World Bank.

My name is pronounced [/ˈkɒnər ˈgɪlrɔɪ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English). I generally use [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) pronouns.

I'm a PhD student in sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle. I use digital and computational methods to study experiences of community, visibility, and belonging, with a substantive focus on queer communities and LGBTQ populations. I have also interned as a quantitative UX researcher and consulted on survey data analysis. 

[My recent projects](/research/) examine demographic and economic changes in gay neighborhoods, the disclosure of sexualities on social media, and the discursive meaning and uses of "community." In other work, I have modeled the impact of coming out on public opinion and used machine learning combined with human knowledge to attempt to predict life outcomes from survey data.

I also strive to create open and accessible [teaching materials](/teaching/), especially for computational social science methods and tools. If you find them useful, let me know!

My name is pronounced [/ˈkɒnər ˈgɪlrɔɪ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English). I generally use [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) pronouns.

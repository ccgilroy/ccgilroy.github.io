# Expressions and experiences of community

My dissertation consists of three interlinked projects about _expressions and experiences of community_ for LGBTQ people. I use computational text analysis and conventional quantitative methods in order to offer a complementary approach to the deeply grounded ethnographic and interview-based research that already exists for queer communities. The cases I've chosen span both digital and location-based communities, allowing me to generalize across contexts.

First, what does "community" mean, as revealed (or constructed) through the ways everyday people use the word? To what extent does it resonate with the sociological concept of _Gemeinschaft_? 

Using a computational approach to text analysis, I offer an empirical understanding of how “community” is used in popular English-language discourse. Through algebraic transformations of word embeddings, I disentangle spatial and sociological connotations of the word. I'll apply this generic embeddings model to LGBTQ-related corpora to see how those specific meanings might diverge or align with more general usage.

Second, how does place matter for individual sense of community? Are measurable features like density and abundance of people with a shared identity enough to explain differences between places?

I use survey measures of both generic and identity-specific belonging from the _Generations_ study to show how sense of community varies for LGBQ people according to the characteristics of where they live. Beyond demographic differences, I'll aim to investigate how residual variation between places might be attributable to variations in place-based cultures.

For my third empirical chapter, I'll investigate the social structure around community-oriented talk by comparing a set of virtual communities.

# Digital traces of sexualities

When do people disclose their sexualities on social media? What can that tell us about sexual identity online?

In collaboration with Ridhi Kashyap, I use aggregate estimates from Facebook's advertising platform to investigate the disclosure of sexuality on social media in the United States. We leverage variation by relationship status, age, and gender to see which factors are associated with the disclosure of LGB or straight sexual orientations. We interpret these variations in sexuality disclosure on social media to primarily reflect sexual identity, intersected in some cases with sexual availability.

# Change in gay neighborhoods

How do gayborhoods change in a time of rising social acceptance?

Gay neighborhoods are meaningful spaces for LGBTQ people, who worry that these spaces are assimilating and gentrifying as LGBTQ people integrate into US society. I show that evidence for widespread gayborhood change is actually quite limited. I webscrape a set of digital gay bar listings to identify gay neighborhoods across over 20 cities, then examine change in these places across several demographic and economic indicators using the American Community Survey.

# Other projects

I have also used agent-based modeling to simulate the impact of coming out on public opinion and used regularized regression models that incorporated scores based on surveys of variable importance for prediction in the Fragile Families Challenge.

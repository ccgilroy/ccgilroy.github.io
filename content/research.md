# Change in gay neighborhoods

How do gayborhoods change in a time of rising social acceptance?

Gay neighborhoods are meaningful spaces for LGBTQ people, who worry that these spaces are assimilating and gentrifying as LGBTQ people integrate into US society. I show that evidence for widespread gayborhood change is actually quite limited. I webscrape a set of digital gay bar listings to identify gay neighborhoods across over 20 cities, then examine change in these places across several demographic and economic indicators using the American Community Survey.

# Digital traces of sexualities

When do people disclose their sexualities on social media? What can that tell us about sexual identity online?

In collaboration with Ridhi Kashyap, I use aggregate estimates from Facebook's advertising platform to investigate the disclosure of sexuality on social media in the United States. We leverage variation by relationship status, age, and gender to see which factors are associated with the disclosure of LGB or straight sexual orientations. We interpret these variations in sexuality disclosure on social media to reflect sexual availability or sexual identity.

# Disentangling the meaning of "community"

What is community? Can we measure experiences of community from text?

"Community" is an ambiguous concept with both sociological and everyday uses. Using a computational approach to text analysis, I offer an empirical understanding of how "community" is used in popular English-language discourse. Through algebraic transformations of word embeddings, I disentangle spatial and sociological connotations of the word.

# Other projects

I have also used agent-based modeling to simulate the impact of coming out on public opinion and used regularized regression models that incorporated scores based on surveys of variable importance for prediction in the Fragile Families Challenge.

# Data and society

I've helped to develop and teach a new course in Data and Society for UW Sociology. 

Data and Society equips students to understand the consequences of the digital data revolution for their everyday lives and for society, in terms of bias, surveillance, inequality, and various forms of social, political and economic change. It also makes "data" tangible and meaningful through an interactive lab on exploratory data analysis and visualization with R, using digital data sources (such as Airbnb listings, Twitter accounts, and Facebook ads) as much as possible. I've taught this course both as the instructor of record and as a teaching assistant / lab instructor.

# Computational social science

I've taught and organized workshops and full courses in computational social science. 

With Emilio Zagheni, I facilitated the IUSSP workshop on Social Media and Demographic Research at IPC 2017 ([materials on GitHub](Social Media and Demographic Research)). In 2018, I organized the Seattle partner location for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science ([SICSS-Seattle](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/seattle/)). I have been a teaching assistant for two advanced courses, Data Science and Population Processes and Bayesian Statistics for the Social Sciences ([2018 course website](https://uw-csss-564.github.io/2018/), [2019 lab materials](https://ccgilroy.github.io/csss564-labs-2019/)). 

# Other courses

I have also been a teaching assistant for foundational courses such as Sociological Theory and substantive courses such as Intimate Relationships.
